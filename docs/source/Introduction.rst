Introduction
************

This package provides a mechanism to predict pathway ontology and potential pathway members 
given a set of candidate enzymes (operon or gene clusters). This method can be used in early
stages of pathway discovery; for example, for selecting ligand libraries for virtual screening 
and experimental studies or as prior information in pathway annotation studies. 

The Python package can be used standalone. A `web server <https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/SimPathFinder/>`_
is also available. Refer to the paper for more details on the method or the algorithm.
